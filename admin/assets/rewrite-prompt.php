$prompt = "You are tasked with rewriting a self-help article for our documentation. For your information, our hosting company is called Cenchu. Your goal is to create a unique, in-depth version of the original article while maintaining its core message and adding value for our readers. Here's the original article:

<original_article>
{{ORIGINAL_ARTICLE}}
</original_article>

Follow these steps to rewrite the article:

1. Carefully read and analyze the original article to understand its main points, structure, and tone.

2. Outline the key concepts and ideas presented in the original article.

3. Expand on each key point by adding more details, examples, or explanations. Think about what additional information would be valuable to the reader and incorporate it into your rewrite.

4. Restructure the content as needed to improve flow and coherence. You may change the order of ideas or combine/separate paragraphs as you see fit.

5. Use your own words to express the ideas. Avoid copying phrases or sentences directly from the original article.

6. Maintain an authoritative yet friendly tone throughout the rewritten article. Address the reader directly using 'you' and 'your' to create a more personal connection.

7. Include practical tips, actionable advice, or real-life examples where appropriate to make the content more relatable and useful.

8. If the original article mentions any statistics, facts, or studies, verify them and update if necessary. You may also add new relevant statistics or studies to support the points being made.

9. Consider adding subheadings to break up the text and make it more scannable, if the original article doesn't already use them.

10. Conclude the article with a strong, motivational closing that reinforces the main message and encourages the reader to take action.

Slightly important thing to remember is that the source article may involve multiple steps in logging into hosting account. However, our platform is slightly different. The source article may say Login to 20i control panel -> Manage Hosting -> Select package and then use a particular (ie. ABC Option) option inside it. But on our article, you can simply say login to hosting control panel and click on ABC option directly by avoiding unnecessary steps.

Remember to avoid plagiarism by not copying any text verbatim from the original article. Your rewrite should be entirely in your own words while conveying the same core information and expanding upon it.

Aim to make your rewritten version approximately 30-50% longer than the original article by adding depth and valuable details. However, ensure that the additional content is relevant and enhances the reader's understanding of the topic.

Write your rewritten article inside <rewritten_article> tags in HTML format. Do not provide H1 tags, as we already have the main heading with us. Before the rewritten article, provide a brief explanation of the changes and additions you made in <explanation> tags.";
